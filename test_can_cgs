You are a senior Angular 21 architect.

In this workspace, create a full Angular 21 app with:

- Angular 21, standalone components, strict mode.
- Clean, feature-based structure (core, shared, features).
- Default global **dark theme** using CSS variables (no hard-coded colors).
- Mock authentication with **roles**: "employee" and "manager".
- Role-based routing + guards:
  - /login
  - /dashboard (common to all)
  - /employee (employee page)
  - /manager (manager-only page)
  - /settings
  - /forbidden (403)
  - 404 page for unknown routes
- Manager should see one extra page (/manager) and an extra menu item that employee cannot see.
- Use a `HasRole` structural directive to show/hide elements based on role.

Architecture:

- `core/`
  - `models/` (User, Role enum)
  - `services/auth.service.ts` (mock login, currentUser, hasRole, hasAnyRole, isAuthenticated, logout)
  - `services/theme.service.ts` (dark theme handling)
  - `guards/auth.guard.ts`
  - `guards/role.guard.ts`
- `shared/`
  - `components/` (layout shell, toolbar, nav)
  - `directives/has-role.directive.ts`
- `features/`
  - `auth/` (LoginComponent with Reactive Forms)
  - `dashboard/`
  - `employee/`
  - `manager/`
  - `settings/`
  - `error/` (Forbidden + NotFound)

Coding standards:

- Standalone components, proper imports.
- OnPush change detection where reasonable.
- Strong typing (no `any`).
- Use CSS/SCSS with CSS variables for dark theme: `--bg-color`, `--text-color`, `--accent-color`, etc.
- Make sure `ng serve` works and:
  - I can log in as employee or manager,
  - see different navigation and page access based on role,
  - get redirected to /forbidden if I try to open /manager without manager role.

Start by scaffolding the folder structure and main routing, then implement services, guards, directives, and core components.
